# The Smith Parasite: A Machine Learning Project

This is a project developed as a part of the Machine Learning course of the Master's in Data Science and Advanced Analytics at NOVA IMS. The objective was to predict whether a patient was infected or not with the Smith Parasite (fictional disease), optimising for the F1-score. The full overview of the project's prompt can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/the-smith-parasite/overview).

## Key Project Components:
1. Data Exploration
2. Data Preprocessing
   * Dealing with inconsistencies found during exploration, missing values and outliers;
   * Feature Engineering
   * Encoding, Imputing and Scaling
   * Feature Selection
3. Model creation and Assessment
   * Experimentation with different models (Random Forest, Extra Trees, Gradient Boosting, Support Vector Machines, K-NN, Neural Networks, Bagging Classifier, Voting Classifier) in a cross-validation pipeline framework
   * Assessment with F1-score
